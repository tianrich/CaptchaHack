Here's a step-by-step guide using Python, the Tesseract OCR engine, and Selenium for browser automation:

Install the required libraries:
pytesseract for OCR
opencv-python for image processing
selenium for browser automation
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pytesseract opencv-python selenium
Install Tesseract OCR:
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the official Tesseract repository - https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

Notes:
Ensure you have the correct path to the Tesseract executable and the WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
Update the image path and URL to match your specific use case.
The code assumes that the g-recaptcha element needs to be present before clicking the submit button, but you might need to handle more specific interactions based on the actual implementation of the recaptcha on the target site.
This script should serve as a starting point, and you can further refine it based on the specific requirements and environment.
